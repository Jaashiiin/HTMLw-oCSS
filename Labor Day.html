        &nbsp;Labor Day in the Philippines, also known as "<b>Araw ng mga Manggagawa</b>" is a day dedicated to honoring the hard work of Filipino workers. 
            It's a time to recognize their contributions to the nation's economy and society, from the agricultural fields to the bustling 
            <img src = "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\3rd yr\HTML\esq.jpg" align = "right" width = "280px" height="auto">urban centers. 
            Labor Day also highlights the ongoing struggle for workers' rights and the need for solidarity among workers across different sectors serving
            as a platform to advocate for better labor standards and policies that prioritize the welfare of workers. It is marked by various 
            activities and events organized by labor unions, government agencies, and civil society groups. These include parades, rallies, and 
            cultural performances that celebrate the achievements and struggles of Filipino workers. It's also a time for workers to come together 
            in solidarity and demand for their rights, whether through peaceful demonstrations or advocacy campaigns.

            PH Labor day has a rich history dating back to its first celebration on <b>May 1, 1903</b>. Organized by the country's inaugural
            labor union, "Union Obrera Democratica de Filipina (U.O.D.F.)," over 100,000 workers marched from Tondo's Plaza Moriones to 
            <img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\3rd yr\HTML\belo1.png" align ="right" width="130px" height="auto"> Malacanang, 
            demanding fair wages and improved working conditions under the American-led government. The U.O.D.F., established in 
            February 1902 by Isabelo Delos Reyes and Herminigildo Cruz, aimed to defend the rights of the working class during American occupation. Following Delos Reyes's
            arrest for rebellion and sedition, Dominador Gomez assumed leadership and continued the advocacy, culminating in the historic 1903 protest.
            Despite challenges and subsequent arrests, the movement persisted, leading to significant legislative changes.
            On April 8, 1908, the Philippine Assembly passed a bill declaring May 1st as Labor Day, formally recognizing the contributions and struggles
            of workers. The inaugural Labor Day celebration in 1913, organized by Herminigildo Cruz, marked the beginning of annual demands for fair 
            labor practices, including the advocacy for an eight-hour workday, an end to child labor, equal standards for women workers, and employer 
            accountability.

            advocating for fair labor practices, supporting initiatives that empower workers, and standing in solidarity with those who 
            continue to fight for justice in the workplace. Together, we can build a society where every worker is valued, respected, and
