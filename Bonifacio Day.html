        &nbsp;Known in the Philippines as 'Araw ng Kapanganakan ni Bonifacio', 
        this day commemorates the birth of Andrés Bonifacio on 30 November 1863. Often called "<i>the Father of the Philippine Revolution</i>", 
        he is a prominent figure who played a pivotal role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule in the late 19th 
        century. A passionate advocate for the rights and welfare of the Filipino people, particularly 
        the impoverished masses who endured exploitation and oppression under such adversities. On this 
        Day, Filipinos across the nation pay tribute to Andrés Bonifacio through various commemorative activities and ceremonies. 
        These include wreath-laying ceremonies at monuments and historical sites dedicated to his memory, 
        as well as educational programs and cultural events highlighting his life and works.<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\3rd yr\HTML\bon3.png" align ="right" width="130px" height="auto">

            &nbsp;In 1892, Bonifacio founded the Katipunan (Kataas-taasang, Kagalang-galangang Katipunan ng mga Anak 
            ng Bayan), a secret society aimed at uniting Filipinos to fight for freedom. Under his leadership, 
            the Katipunan grew rapidly, drawing support from various sectors of society. The spark for the revolution 
            came on August 23, 1896, when the discovery of the Katipunan's existence led to the outbreak of the 
            Philippine Revolution. Bonifacio and his fellow revolutionaries took up arms against the Spanish 
            authorities, initiating a struggle that would ultimately lead to the overthrow of colonial rule. Despite facing challenges and setbacks,
            particularly the disputes which arose during the Tejeros convention, where Aguinaldo won the presidency, 
            leading to Bonifacio's rebellion against the revolutionary government. 
            His subsequent arrest, trial, and execution on May 10, 1897, stirred controversy. As the Katipunan 
            had it's own constitution and was in control of the Philippines before the creation of the first 
            government, many have argued that Bonifacio should be remembered as the first president of the 
            Philippines and not Aguinaldo.

            Bonifacio is remembered on his birthday, rather than the date of his death 
            (as in the case of the main national hero, José Rizal) as he was executed by the Filipino 
            revolutionary government and not by the Spanish. Additionally, November 30th was first declared as Bonifacio Day 
            through Philippine Legislature Act No. 2946 where it was signed by then-Governor General Francis Burton Harrison in 1921.

        In observance of Andrés Bonifacio's legacy, let us celebrate Bonifacio Day by keeping the principles of justice, 
        freedom, and unity that he battled for. We hope that his bravery and selflessness would motivate us to fight towards a 
        more equitable and better society where all Filipinos can live out their aspirations.
